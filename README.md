# Naninovel Ink Adapter

Allows [Inkle's Ink script](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) to run [Navinovel](https://naninovel.com)'s script commands.

## Demo

To run the demo:
1. Clone this project
2. Open the Naninovel Ink Adapter Unity folder in Unity
3. Open the Assets/Scenes/StartScene scene
4. Press 'Play'

You should see the full Naninovel demo prefixed with 'You are now running an Ink script!' You can see the ink script with Naninovel demo commands [here](https://github.com/fantabulous-tech/naninovel-ink-adapter/blob/master/Naninovel%20Ink%20Adapter%20Unity/Assets/Naninovel%20Ink%20Demo%20Script/Demo.ink).

## Setup

To create an Ink-driven game that runs Naninovel commands from scratch:
1. Create a Unity project with both [Naninovel](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/game-toolkits/naninovel-visual-novel-engine-135453) and [Ink](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/ink-unity-integration-60055) Unity Store packages installed
2. Copy the `Assets/Naninovel Ink Adapter/` folder into your project
3. Add the `NaninovelInkAdapter` component to a gameObject in your start scene
4. Fill in the `Ink Json Asset` field with the ink JSON you wish to run.
5. Open `Edit > Project Settings... > Naninovel > Scripts`
6. Click `Manage Scripts Resources` button at the bottom
7. Add the custom `Start Ink` Naninovel script (found in the `Naninovel Ink Adapter` folder)
8. Click `<- Back to Configuration`
9. Assign `Start Ink` as the `Start Game Script` property

Hitting 'Play' in the Unity Editor should now run the Ink script when you start your Naninovel game.

## Custom Inky Highlighting

The included `Inky/Inky.exe` is a version of Inky that will highlight all `@commands` and scope words used in those commands to help with editing Navinovel scripts in Inky.
